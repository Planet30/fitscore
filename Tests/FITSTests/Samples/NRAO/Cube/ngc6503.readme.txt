\noindent Alternate Names: 

\noindent Description of Observation: (e.g., date of observation,
telescope(s) used, frequencies, polarization type, resolution, 
deconvolution method) 

NGC~6503 (17:49:57.7, +70:09:25.7 [1950], L=100, b=30.5) is a normal
spiral galaxy, with morphological type SA(s)cd (de~Vaucouleurs). The
observation had a total duration of 4~hours, on 12-April-1983, and
used 21 antennas in C array, with 32 channels at 48~KHz spacing
(10~km/s), and integration time 60~sec.  Exposure time on the galaxy
was about 2~hours.

\noindent Description of Image: (e.g., type of source, scientific reason
for observing, notable source features)

This 21~cm cube is a {\it textbook case} of a spiral galaxy rotation
curve. The AIPS task {\tt GAL} was developed and debugged using this
observation as the test data. The cube has also been used extensively
by the AIPS Group for testing ``movie loop'' display code and for
various visualization experiments.

The 1.1~Jy quasar 1749+70.1 was within the primary beam at L band.
The quasar totally dominated the dirty maps, its sidelobes being about
10x brighter than the 21~cm galaxy emission.  The 6~MHz continuum map
delivered with the cube was subtracted from each of the 31 planes of
the cube, and the quasar disappeared completely.
